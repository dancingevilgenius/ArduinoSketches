  Deep Sleep LoRaWAN TTN example

  This example assumes the ESP32 stays powered, but puts it in a very low-power
  "deep sleep" mode between sends to the network.

  This example joins a LoRaWAN network and will send uplink packets. Before you
  start, you will have to register your device at
  https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/ After your device is registered, you can run
  this example. The device will join the network and start uploading data.

  LoRaWAN v1.1 requires storing parameters persistently. RadioLib does this by
  using the Arduino EEPROM storage. The ESP32 does not have EEPROM memory, so
  the Arduino code from Espressif has code that emulates EEPROM in its "NVS"
  flash key-value storage. This unfortunately means that every change of a
  single but re- writes the entire emulated "EEPROM" to flash again. 

  That would be great for the occasional configuration change, but we need to
  keep state after every single interaction with the LoRaWAN network. Flash
  memory can only be erased and written to a limited number of times. This is
  why this library contains a fork of RadioLib that uses ESP32_RTC_EEPROM, which
  writes to the memory of the ESP32's onboard Real-Time Clock which is kept
  powered during the chip's "deep sleep", which uses almost no power.

  This example then backs up that RTC RAM memory to flash
    a) every time it is woken up with a wiped RTC RAM,
    b) whenever it receives a downlink packet, or 
    c) every so many times as set by BACKUP_EVERY.

  This backup is then automatically loaded when the RTC RAM is empty (after a
  reset or power failure) so that we hang on to enough state information to
  rejoin the network in a secure manner.
